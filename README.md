# chess relief

A basic chess program for the command line. To run,
```sh
cd chess-relief
chmox +x ./build_and_run.sh
./build_and_run.sh
```

## Dependencies

This should be run in a Bash shell, since it uses Bash color manipulation to print the board. It also requires `ocamlopt`, which comes by default with [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) (follow link for installation instructions).
